\# Rescue Projectile -- Trajectory Calculator

This Python project is an interactive physics calculator that models
projectile motion in both horizontal and angled launches. It enables
users to compute required velocities, determine valid launch angles, and
visualize how gravitational differences across celestial bodies affect
trajectories.

\## Features

1\. Calculates horizontal velocity (required to cover a given distance
when launched from a certain height). 2. Finds possible launch angles
(for a given initial speed, distance, and height). 3. Generates a bar
chart showing required launch angles on various celestial bodies (e.g.,
Moon, Mars, Earth).

## How to run

1. Download the projekt.py file.
2. Open a terminal and run: python projekt.py or python3 projekt.py (depending on your system).
3. Follow the instructions. 

\## Requirements

\- Python 3.7 or newer - \`matplotlib\` library
